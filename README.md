# Ackee Cookbook Web Version

Welcome, stranger! 👨🏻‍💻 Wanna join us at [Ackee](https://ackee.cz/)? Or you just don't know what to do on a lazy sunday afternoon? 🌤 💤

We have a tasty task for you! Create a webapp to browse characters from Star Wars (or at least the first few movies) and send it to us as a link to a GitHub repo / dropbox / GDrive or similar.

## Description

- Come up with your own design
- The app should consist of:
    - Page with the list of all characters with server-side search (i.e. the API does the searching)
    - Detail page for a character
    - Page for creating a new character with validation
        - There is no API route for this so just *console.log* the data (or better - save the new character to local storage or similar db)
- If you want to add anything extra, go for it!

## Technical details

- API info is at [https://swapi.dev/](https://swapi.dev/)
- The app should run in common browsers (i.e. you don't have to support IE10 and lower).
- Use React

We highly recommend using official Next.js skeleton - https://github.com/AckeeCZ/next-app-template or just plain [Next.js boilerplate](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/create-next-app). Or you can just use CRA or something 🤷🏿
